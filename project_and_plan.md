    Repository Ingestion:
        Analyze the codebase using backend Rust services or client-side Wasm.
    Processing and Transformation:
        LLM-powered insights are generated, converting raw data into documentation, diagrams, or simulations.
    Web Presentation:
        Users interact with the final outputs via a browser:
            View architectural insights as graphs.
            Read documentation in real-time.
            Engage with interactive educational tools or game objects.

5. Technical Ecosystem Overview

Relevance: With LLMs integrated into every development stage, Rust ensures that automation and AI-generated code adhere to safe and high-performance practices.
3. Accessibility Through WebAssembly (Wasm)

    Universal Deployment: WebAssembly allows Rust code to run in the browser, bringing high-performance and low-latency computation to client-side applications.
    Private, Secure Sandboxes: Users can execute Rust-Wasm modules securely in isolated environments, maintaining privacy and security even for sensitive computations.
    Cross-Platform Compatibility: With Wasm, the same Rust code can run natively on servers, embedded systems, or client-side browsers.

Relevance: Making powerful tools accessible via browsers democratizes software, reducing the dependency on platform-specific runtimes.
4. Redesigning Computational Paradigms

Vision: Software must evolve beyond its traditional paradigms to embrace safety, LLM empowerment, and accessibility as primary goals.

    Shift in Responsibility: Historically, safety and accessibility were retrofitted. Your service aims to bake them into the foundation, leveraging Rust’s design as a language and Wasm for distribution.
    Universal Adaptability: Through this service, you automate the complex process of translating legacy repositories into Rust, effectively modernizing outdated codebases.

The Service’s Role in This Journey

    Abstract Complexity: The tool abstracts the hardship of understanding and manually porting legacy systems, automating the translation of various languages to Rust while enhancing comprehension with LLM-generated documentation and visual aids.
